## Limitations

- Link attachment to the intended phrase requires editorial comparison with the authoritative source.
- When navigation_mode is page.set_content-fallback, controls and persistence use an exact-HTML injection plus deterministic Storage shim; this does not prove local-file navigation. This run never proves Opera-specific behavior or publication-platform reconstruction.
- A modest-laptop claim requires testing on that class of machine; this report records only the current environment.
